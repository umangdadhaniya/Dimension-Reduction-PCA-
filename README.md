# Problem Statement 

1. Perform hierarchical and K-means clustering on the dataset. After that, perform PCA on the dataset and extract the first 3 principal components and make a new dataset with these 3 principal components as the columns. Now, on this new dataset, perform hierarchical and K-means clustering. Compare the results of clustering on the original dataset and clustering on the principal components dataset (use the scree plot technique to obtain the optimum number of clusters in K-means clustering and check if youâ€™re getting similar results with and without PCA)

2. A pharmaceuticals manufacturing company is conducting a study on a new medicine to treat heart diseases. The company has gathered data from its secondary sources and would like you to provide high level analytical insights on the data. Its aim is to segregate patients depending on their age group and other factors given in the data. Perform PCA and clustering algorithms on the dataset and check if the clusters formed before and after PCA are the same and provide a brief report on your model. You can also explore more ways to improve your model.
